# Current Sprint

## Goal

Reach compiler runtime-validation readiness before Homey adapter implementation:
build the real layered rules pipeline (HA-derived + project generic/product rules), export compiled profiles, and validate them against live ZWJS data without on-the-fly compilation.

## In Progress

- Compiler-first completion push: real rules pipeline + compiled artifact workflow + live ZWJS validation

## Recently Completed

1. Completed Phase 2 HA import foundation:
   - `discovery.py` subset extractor in `packages/compiler`
   - extracted and generated HA artifact contracts
   - translation pipeline + tooling (`ha-import:extract`, `ha-import:report`)
   - semantic propagation (`assumed_state`, `allow_multi`, `entity_registry_enabled_default`)
   - pinned-source drift guard with current full coverage on local HA checkout
2. Built Phase 3 catalog tooling baseline:
   - `catalog-devices/v1` artifact contract + loader
   - `catalog` CLI (`fetch`, `normalize`, `merge`, `diff`, `validate`, `summary`)
   - conflict precedence (`warn|error`) and diagnostics formats
   - catalog index lookups (`catalogId`, product triple)
3. Integrated catalog context into compiler diagnostics:
   - `catalogLookup` in file-based compile results
   - `profile.catalogMatch` annotation in compiled profiles
   - catalog-aware curation hints and stable `diagnosticDeviceKey`
   - explicit file-based `unknownDeviceReport` diagnostics (known/unknown/no-catalog)
4. Closed Phase 3 scope decisions:
   - catalog/diagnostics foundation accepted for now
   - curation-seed generation explicitly deferred as unnecessary abstraction at this stage
   - added `compiler:inspect-live` to inspect compiled profiles directly from a live ZWJS instance
5. Clarified runtime curation ownership:
   - runtime curation patch schema/apply behavior belongs to the Homey adapter
   - compiler remains focused on compiled profiles + provenance/diagnostics
6. Added live compile inspection tooling (`compiler:inspect-live`) for rapid validation, with a follow-up decision to prefer compiled-artifact application for runtime-style inspection

## Next Tasks

1. Add compiler build/export command for compiled profiles artifact (all layers)
2. Create real rule directories and pipeline outputs (`rules/ha-derived`, `rules/project/generic`, `rules/project/product`)
3. Generate/commit HA-derived rules covering the currently supported HA discovery extraction set
4. Build initial project-generic ruleset for device-profile inference from Z-Wave configuration/metadata
5. Add live inspection path that applies compiled profiles artifact to ZWJS node data (no on-the-fly compile)
6. Defer Homey adapter implementation until compiler runtime-validation readiness milestone is reached

## Risks / Unknowns

- Catalog source conflicts will grow as new real sources are added (official catalog, `zwave-js` config exports, observed captures)
- Compiler performance may degrade as HA-derived + project rules + catalog-aware diagnostics scale up
- Risk of overloading compiler behavior with catalog heuristics before precedence policy is explicitly designed
- Risk of boundary drift if runtime curation semantics are reintroduced into compiler package
- Risk of delaying adapter work if generic ruleset scope is not bounded for the first “compiler complete enough” milestone

## Notes

- Homey compiler architecture and phase progress:
  - `plan/homey-translation-compiler-plan.md`
- Current system architecture overview:
  - `docs/architecture.md`
- Diagnostic CLIs support:
  - `summary`, `markdown`, `json`, `json-pretty`, `json-compact`, `ndjson`
